## {{ page.title }}

A few weeks ago, I was enlisted to write an article for (Software Developer's Journal)[http://sdjournal.org/]
on Hadoop. The article won't go to press for a few weeks still, but that's not what we're here to talk about.

As part of delivering my article, the editor wanted images of my source code - as in screenshots. How awful, 
I thought, but I am of the mind that if you're going to do something, you may as well do it right.

This brings us to the LaTeX and the "listings" package. LaTeX is a document markup language and typesetting
system commonly used in academia. You give it some funky looking markup, and it gives you really nice looking
documents (pdfs and the like). The listings package enables you to make nice looking vector graphics from your
source code listings.

TODO add image here

After spending an afternoon getting texlive installed on my laptop and fiddling around with the settings, I was
getting some nice looking PNGs of my source code listings for the article. 

That's when I had the bright idea to make it into a web app
